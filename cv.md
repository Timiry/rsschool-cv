## About me
I am second-year student of CFU. I don't have any work experience yet, but I am actively studying both at the university and on my own. I am interested in frontend because I like to create something beautiful and immediately see the result of my work. I am responsible for my work, I try to do it on time and I know how to work in a team. My goal is to get enough knowledge and experience to get a job as a frontend developer.

## Skills
* HTML, CSS
* C#, C++
* Python
* Git, GitHub
* Figma

## Code examples
One of my solutions from Codewars:
```
using System;
using System.Text;

public class Kata
{
  public static int SquareDigits(int n)
  {
    if(n == 0) return 0;
    StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
    int a;
    while (n > 0)
    {
      a = n % 10;
      a = a*a;
      n /= 10;
      buf.Insert(0, a.ToString());
    }
    return Convert.ToInt32(buf.ToString());
  }
}
```
